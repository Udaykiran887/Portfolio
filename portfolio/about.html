                Our project, Basic Expense Splitter, was designed to simplify expense management in group settings. The app allows users to create groups, add expenses, and automatically calculate how much each member owes or is owed. By focusing on accuracy and efficiency, we aimed to make managing shared expenses easier for everyone.<br>
                <br>
